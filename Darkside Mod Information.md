# About Darkside
Darkside is an overhaul mod exclusive to Nightmare and Lethal Zone. The mod originated from my first overhaul  
mod called Dead End Heaven. This mod aims to flesh out several mechanics in the game all the while giving players a  
good challenge. The mod emphasizes the managing of not only regular resources but your community itself.  
Fleshes out the use of labor, distraction items, special items from Heartland and how you should handle various  
scenarios. This isn't my mod. But it's mod by everyone in the SoD2 modding discord. The same applies to  
Dead End Heaven. Credit goes to everyone who deserves it. Consider donating to me and the modders in the modding  
discord. Without them my overhauls and my mods wouldn't be a thing. I'm not telling you to go donate! Okay?!  
We accept donations but never required.
