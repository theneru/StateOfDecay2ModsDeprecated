FAQ - Frequent Annoy~ahem~ Asked Questions
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Q: Where can I find the new outposts?
A: Autoshop Outpost -> Basically an Autoshop Building [Can be found in all maps]
Nursery Outpost -> Plant Nursery/Greenhouses [Notably Meagher Valley has these buildings]
Post Office Outpost -> Only Providence has this building. Trumbull Valley [Homecoming] has this building.
Library Outpost -> Drucker and Cascade has this building
Church Outpost -> Drucker and Trumbull valley has this building.
Police Station Outpost -> Providence Ridge, Cascade Hills, Drucker County. Does not exist in Meagher Valley
and Trumbull Valley [Homecoming]
Factory Outposts -> [Factory Buildings] Trumbull Valley and Meagher Valley. [Workshop Buildings] Cascade Hills, Meagher Valley and Drucker County.
Factory Outpost is not present in Providence. [I could be wrong and scanned the map sleepily/lazily]

Q: Will you ever update the No Labor version to have the latest changes in the one with Labor Cost
A: I just did. And is based on V1.1.1. But I might not update it regularly.

Q: Why can't I upgrade the Nursery and Safehouse Outposts?
A: You need the State of Decay 2 Mod Manager by KaiHeilos to integrate those new Outposts.

Q: Why does my game crash when approaching X Outpost?
A: You need the State of Decay 2 Mod Manager by KaiHeilos to integrate those new Outposts.

Q: Why can't I see Homebases and Survey Points at the start?
A: I've hidden them as of V1.1.55.

Q: Can't you just add a toggle button to enable the facility functions at the cost of Labor?
A: I definitely can, but I am limited to 5 buttons at most. That and it doesn't sit right
with me that the community is still gaining resources from the outpost without the cost of Labor.
Also, also. I would need to edit a few more files to achieve that and will inevitable become
a conflict with other mods.
