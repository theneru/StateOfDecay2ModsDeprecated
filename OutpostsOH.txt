Q & A
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Q: Will you ever update the No Labor version to have the latest changes in the one with Labor Cost
A: No.

Q: Why can't I upgrade the Nursery and Safehouse Outposts?
A: You need the State of Decay 2 Mod Manager by KaiHeilos to integrate those new Outposts.

Q: Can't you just add a toggle button to enable the facility functions at the cost of Labor?
A: I definitely can, but I am limited to 5 buttons at most. That and it doesn't sit right
with me that the community is still gaining resources from the outpost without the cost of Labor.
Also, also. I would need to edit a few more files to achieve that and will inevitable become
a conflict with other mods.
